\newcommand{\guidesummary}{\guidebox{Briefly summarise what you have done in the interim since the last meeting, list any documents/code outputs which may contain further information. The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of whats done. You are \textbf{STRONGLY} encouraged to use the opportunity of the report writing to start writing up your research as you go along. This approach makes compiling other submissions much easier.  Aim for page or so of writing at least rather than a few lines.}}

\newcommand{\guidedates}{\guidebox{When did your previous meeting happen? Has there been a substantial delay or missed meetings. If so why? Include any notes relevant to dates of your next meeting.}}

\newcommand{\guidegoals}{\guidebox{\begin{itemize}
    \item What were your agreed goals for the current reporting period?
    \item Copy these from your previous weeks agreed goals in the meeting.
    \item Make a specific note if any goals span multiple periods.
    \item Include details of any goals you didn't achieve (and note \textbf{why} in report below)
\end{itemize}
}}

\newcommand{\guidegoalsok}{\guidebox{Which of the above goals did you achieve - briefly comment on the goal and how it was met along with any challenges in meeting it.
}}


\newcommand{\guidebottlenecks}{\guidebox{
Challenges  that limit your ability to get things done to happen from time to time.
\begin{itemize}
     \item What were the issues/tasks you had trouble with? 
     \item What assistance did you need to continue? From Who?
     \item Are there any issues still hanging over from previous reports?
\end{itemize}
}}

\newcommand{\guidegoalsnext}{\guidebox{
\begin{itemize}
    \item What do you propose as the target goals for the period to the next meeting?  Do you feel they are they realistic ?
    \item Choose 2-3 goals. These should be revised if need be in the meeting and entered into the document for next week.
\end{itemize}
}}


\newcommand{\guiderateyourwork}{\guidebox{
\begin{itemize}
    \item How did you feel you worked ? 
    \item Did you achieve all your goals ? if not why not?
    \item How can you improve your performance?
    \item Provide a rating out of 10 in addition to the above. This rating should reflect the material reported above.
\end{itemize}
}}

\newcommand{\guidelearning}{\guidebox{\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the most useful/interesting thing you learned or did this period?
    \item Even bad blocks  usually yield something positive if you think about it
\end{itemize}
}}

\newcommand{\guidereport}{\guidebox{\begin{itemize}
    \item What is a summary of what you have been working on? 
    \item This is often best kept as a couple of sentences, and refer to an attached or accompanying document which contains the writing (and can be formatted easily).
    \item Writing little bits often allows you to 'bank' content for the thesis and papers, as well as giving you practice, and allowing you to check your writing style, use of citations and most importantly your research direction.
\end{itemize}
}}

\newcommand{\guidereadings}{\guidebox{\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the most useful/interesting paper you read this week?
    \item List what you have been doing research wise - papers read/written/resources found. Research should be ongoing.
    \item Citing the papers here will ensure they get included in the formatted list below.
    \item Include papers as a proper bibliography here so that  your supervisor can see what you are reading and that references are correct and captured in the \texttt{.bib} file. Its easier to get it right early as opposed to trying to fix a everything to do with references at the end when you are under pressure.
    \item It is not necessary to provide a summary of every paper, but sometimes its worth writing some key elements up as to why you found a paper was particularly important.
